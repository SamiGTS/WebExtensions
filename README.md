# Web Extensions

This repository contains three web extensions designed to enhance your informal learning experience. Each `.zip` file includes a complete extension package.

## How to Download
1. **Download all extensions at once** by clicking the green **Code** button above, then selecting **Download ZIP**. This will download all files as a single `.zip` archive.
2. **Extract** the downloaded `.zip` file. Inside, you will find three separate `.zip` files, each containing an extension.
3. **Extract each of the three `.zip` files** to access the individual extension folders. Now you should have three folders.
